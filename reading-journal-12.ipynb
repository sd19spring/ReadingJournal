This is great because most of the time you just write the same code you always would (the `try` part), but you can gracefully deal with errors instead of crashing your program (the `except` part).\n",
    "\n",
    "The part that's not so great about the example code is the fact that the naked `except` block catches *every* type of Exception indiscriminately. As an (contrived) example, imagine your program did `reciprocal = 1/value`. You will get different errors and the fix may be different if `value` is 0 versus if it is `\"pasta\"` (try it).\n"
