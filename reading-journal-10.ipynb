    " 1. An `__init__` method that initializes an attribute named `pouch_contents` to an empty list.\n",
    " 2. A method named `put_in_pouch` that takes an object of any type and adds it to `pouch_contents`.\n",
    " 3. A `__str__` method that returns a string representation of the `Kangaroo` object and the contents of the pouch.\n",
