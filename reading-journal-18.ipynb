    "When designing an algorithm, there are a multitude of factors to consider (anything from the *actual* run time of an algorithm to the impact the algorithm has on society). Name three considerations beyond the order of growth (big-Oh) of an algorithm that are important to consider when analyzing an algorithm.   Next, choose one of these considerations and find a reading (e.g., an news article, a Wikipedia page) that discusses this consideration in light of a specific algorithm."
